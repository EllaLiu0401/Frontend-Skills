# Refactoring Prompts

Prompt templates for improving code structure, performance, and maintainability without changing functionality.

## Contents

Prompts in this category help you:
- Improve code readability
- Reduce complexity
- Extract reusable patterns
- Optimize performance
- Modernize legacy code
- Apply design patterns

## Available Templates

*As you add prompt templates, list them here*

Example structure:
- [Component Refactoring](component-refactoring.md) - Restructure components
- [Extract Custom Hook](extract-custom-hook.md) - Pull out reusable logic
- [Reduce Complexity](reduce-complexity.md) - Simplify complex code
- [Performance Optimization](performance-optimization.md) - Optimize slow code

## Refactoring Guidelines

### When to Refactor

- Code is hard to understand
- Logic is duplicated
- Function/component is too long
- Too many dependencies or parameters
- Performance is poor
- Tests are difficult to write

### What to Preserve

- **Functionality**: Behavior should remain identical
- **API**: Public interfaces should stay compatible
- **Tests**: Existing tests should still pass

### What to Improve

- **Readability**: Clearer naming, simpler logic
- **Structure**: Better organization, proper abstraction
- **Performance**: Faster execution, less memory
- **Maintainability**: Easier to modify and extend

## Refactoring Strategies

### Extract Functions/Components
Break large pieces into smaller, focused units

### Use Established Patterns
Apply well-known design patterns

### Simplify Conditionals
Replace nested conditions with early returns or lookup tables

### Remove Duplication
Extract common logic into reusable functions

### Improve Naming
Use descriptive, intention-revealing names
